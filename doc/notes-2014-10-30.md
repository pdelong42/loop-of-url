 - Mock a webserver for testing.  [I'm researching this now.]

 - Mention choice of hash, and why I think hash collisions aren't a
   major deal to worry about.

 - Add a --version option.

 - Possibly inspect the contents of the exceptions for more
   fine-grained use.

 - Use more descriptive variable names.

 - Add more comments (well, *any* comments).

 - Test the scenario in which the file is unreadable, and catch that
   exception.

 - Handle malformed lines in the file.
 - [DONE] Add a license.  [I'm using the MIT license.]


 - [NO] Consider namespacing using the Java conventions (e.g.,
   name.delong.paul.loop-of-url.core).  [Nobody else in the Clojure
   community does this.]

 - [NO] Replace the 1e6 and the 1e-6 with 1.0e6 or 1.0e-6, but
   ultimately replace it with a properly named constant.  [This is
   scientific notation, which has been in computer languages since
   time immemorial.  Deal with it.]

 - [NO] Don't right-align the names of the exceptions.  [Nah, I like
   this, and I find the code easier to read, so I'm keeping it.]

 - [NO] Come up with a better name than "timer-wrapper".  [Out of pure
   coincidence, my implementation of this function is almost identical
   to that of clojure.core/time.  However, the main difference is that
   it returns the result rather than printing it out (which is what I
   needed).  It also seems to use some of the Java integration
   semantics, which my implementation might benefit from using.]
